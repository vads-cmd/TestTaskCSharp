# TestTaskCSharp
Test Task for WebDriver on C#


It's a simple version of google search results test. If I won't stop now I will refactor it more and more :)
What needs to be updated
- For more then one test it will be good to create TestBase Class and move SetUp and TearDown methods there. 
- For helpers we may create main application class in Helpers package to control driver
